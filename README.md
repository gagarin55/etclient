# Etclient

An bare minimum Ethereum client built on top of SputnikVM and
`etcommon-worldstate`
storage. See [this page](https://that.world/~source/etclient.html) for
the current progress.

Note that there's no code there yet, and there's no plan for providing
anything other than a light client -- no full client, no
`web3`/FFI/JSON-RPC/wallet (those should be provided by another
library), no GUI (use Emerald instead).
